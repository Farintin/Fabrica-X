# Fabrica-X Technical Challenge Submission

This repository contains my submission for the React Native Technical Challenge for the [Pikd] role, demonstrating capabilities in UI structure, animations, data handling, and performance.

## Project Goals

The task required the implementation of two screens based on the provided Figma design:

1.  **Challenge Detail Screen (Animation-Focused):** Evaluates UI structure, clean component architecture, and smooth, meaningful animations.
2.  **Leaderboard Screen (Data-Focused):** Evaluates data modeling, API abstraction (mocking), efficient list rendering, filtering, and pagination logic.

## Tech Stack

- React Native (Expo SDK 50)
- TypeScript
- React Navigation (Native Stack & Tabs)
- React Native Reanimated (for high-performance animations)

## How to Run

1.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
2.  Start the project: `npm start` (or `npx expo start`)
3.  Run on device/simulator by scanning the QR code with the Expo Go app.

## Deliverables

Video recordings for both iOS and Android demonstrating the required animations, loading, and filtering functionality are included in the `/videos` directory.
